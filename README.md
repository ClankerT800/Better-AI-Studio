# Better AIstudio

Save Time, Stay Productive

Better AIstudio is a must-have Chrome extension for people who use Google's AIstudio.

The main goal of this extension is to make AI studio better.

Instead of manually adjusting the settings, and rewriting the system instructions for EVERY SINGLE CHAT; you can just set up a preset inside Better AIstudio, and all that will be done automatically without you even having to press a single button! Just set it up and forget about it!

## Settings

You can adjust:

- **Temperature**: the creativity allowed in the responses
  - I'd recommend to set it around 0.75 (or even lower if you're coding).
  - If you want Gemini to strictly follow your instructions: set it low.
  - If you want Gemini to be creative: set it high
  - Just leave it as default if you don't know what it is.

- **Top P**: Probability threshold for top-p sampling

- **Code Execution**: Enables Gemini to write and execute code to solve complex problems and perform calculations.

- **Grounding With Google Search**: 
  - If you need up-to-date responses; turn it on
  - If you want it to follow your system instructions; turn it off

- **System Instructions**: You can tell it to respond using minimum text and give you straight forward answers for example.
  - My favorite is to tell Gemini to keep everything as concise as possible.
  - You can also feed it information about you; think of it like ChatGPT's memory feature. With the help of Better AIstudio, you now have memory in AIstudio for all chats!

And all that without affecting the performance of AI studio, if anything it makes it run even faster!
